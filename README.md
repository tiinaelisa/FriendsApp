# FriendsApp: Web-based low-threshold app for finding new friends

<b>Technologies</b> include: Java, SpringBoot, Spring Security, postgreSQL, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Docker, AWS

<b>AWS Services</b> include: Lambda, DynamoDB, ECR/ECS, RDS   

This was our final project at AW Academy, the grand result of four Junior Cloud Developers, developed in the period of 9 days.
The app itself was fully functional at the time of presenting, only extra features have been added and worked on later.

The app consists of a UI, which was mainly my responsibility as I wanted to learn new technologies (= frontend) during the final project, backend that we all worked on, a postgreSQL database on Docker, and it is hosted on the AWS cloud.

<b>Pro bono project</b>

The project is close to be finished and our dream is to publish it for the audience free of charge. For this reason, only the readme file is presented here and the source code will not be shared publicly on GitHub for future security reasons. 

<b>Features:</b>

- authentication & authorization - user registration & log in and log out
- editable user profile with relevant information such as location, age, introduction, interests etc.
- list of all users (and their profiles you can visit)
- search function to narrow down users by e.g. location, interests
- friend lists where users can add other users as friends
- one-on-one chat

<b>Why friends app?</b>

- We believe that a "stranger is an old friend you just haven't met yet". There are numerous lonely people across all age groups, with an ever growing amount with access to devices connected to the Internet. According to studies, involuntary loneliness can cause and/or contribute to a range of not only mental but also physical conditions, including depression and heart diseases. 
- This is a severe problem yet it's relatively easily if not solved, at least eased: bringing people together via technology.
- This is the very reason why we wanted to create an app for finding friends, as there are not really many such apps around. Different social media platforms cater for either staying in touch with existing friends, following inspirational influencers, or for finding a romantic partner. Ours is designed ultimately only for finding new friends, worldwide or in a narrowed down location or filtered through other search criteria.
